# Logistic map

## Groups affected: group 1 and 3

The goal of this project is to be able to produce videos and widget representing some of the elements connected to the logistic map and the Mandelbroot set.

Most importantly you should be able to reproduce some part of the videos provided in <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovJcsL7vyrk&app=desktop>

Helps on the Mandelbroot set can also be found here: <http://josephsalmon.eu/HLMA310.html>, see `TP3-numpy_matplolib.pdf` and `TP3-numpy_matplolib.ipynb`

## Widget

The widget for this element should control the evolution of the system.
For that you could consult <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map>
and try to produce a widget representing: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map#/media/File:LogisticCobwebChaos.gif>
